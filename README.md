## React with Auth0 template description

This is a template for building react applications. Auth0 authentication is already build in, just add your private info in a .env file. This template also includes bootstrap, react-router-dom, and axios. I plan on adding redux in the near future.

# Setup

Step one:
Npm i

Step two:
Create your .env file put it in the root folder of your project.
Add your auth0 information.

REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN = YourDomainHere
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID = Your ClientIdHere
REACT_APP_AUDIENCE = YourAudienceHere

Note: dont forget to add your .env to your .gitignore :)

## Start your project

Nmp start in your cli.
It should be served on port 3000.
